# Another Wireless Demo

Various libraries are needed depending on what/which wireless technology you will be using.  

These all pretty much do the same thing, as the demo was to see how far each could transmit inside a building with walls, and metal sheveling.  

The LoRa demo is different in it transmits the temperature to a oled receiver.  
The reason was I already had that code written and working so it was easier to just reuse it.  

The other sketches, the transmitter have a button that is pushed, and the receiver will blink a LED.  

5 Different technologies are used:  
LoRa (915Mhz), ESP8266 Wifi MESH (2.4ghz), nRF24L01 (2.4ghz), Moteino RFM12B (915mhz), FS1000A (ASK 433mhz).
